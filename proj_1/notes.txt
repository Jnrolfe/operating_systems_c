1.
in create process
{
    example_run_command()
}

2. implement all run_<cmd>'s

3. then implement the forks in create process

For the job struct:
    there should be a jobs_deq -> |Job_1|Job_2|Job_3|...|
    each job should have a pid_deq -> |pid_1|pid_2|pid_2|...|
    each job should have a copy of the command using job.cmd = get_cmd_str()
        get_cmd_str() is defined already
        needs to be "freed" eventually
